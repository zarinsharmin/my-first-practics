                Pizza is one of the most sought-after dishes of Italian cuisine and is one of the easy dishes that you
                can prepare at home for your loved ones. The only setback is - making the perfect pizza base. Not
                everyone can make it. However, in this easy recipe, we give you step-by-step details on how to make a
                pizza using the fresh pizza base. Though you can buy a pizza base from the nearest superstore or market,
                the real taste of a pizza will only come when you make a fresh pizza.

            <div>Ice cream is a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a snack or dessert. It may be made from milk or
                cream and is flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or
                vanilla, or with fruit such as strawberries or peaches. It can also be made by whisking a flavored cream
                base and liquid nitrogen together. Food coloring is sometimes added, in addition to stabilizers. </div>
